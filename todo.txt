In TexttoolsGUI.java:
	Implement/fix Menubar
	Add commands to activate a particular panel in results
	Add logic to get selected JRadioButton and display results
	Separate GUI from actual tools
	Read text from a file
	Center panel when opening
	reset label - when invisible, still need to reserve it's space.
		change text instead of setvisible(false) ?

Remove interface class and make texttools member functions static?
